# Multi-Agent-Learning-Paper-Review

## Course Presentation
The Multi-Agent Learning is a PhD course held at Polimi in 2023 which it focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of scenarios where multiple agents are learning.
The main topics introduced in classes are game theoretical models, as well as their representations, and learning techniques. As for learning techniques, we not only characterized their algorithmic form but also studied and proved their guarantees, in the form of regret bounds.
Particular attention has been paid to auction settings and sequential games.

## Evaluation and Examination
The object of the evaluation is a paper review. The list of rules is:
- the paper is assigned by professors to students
- the paper is related to one of the topics discussed in classes
- the paper review must be no longer than 5 pages
- the paper review must include a critical elaboration of the paper, displaying pros and cons
- the paper paragraphs are predefined
